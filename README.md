# Special behavior

By default, the following is required to change block states by right-clicking
- Player is in creative mode
- Have `dummyitemsblocks.changestate` permission, default: op
- Holding an arrow named `Change State` in either main hand or offhand
  - Can be obtained by: ```/give player arrow 1 {display:{Name:"Change State"}}```

Customizable using the `Main::setCanChangeStatesClosure()` method

### Examples of block state changes by right-clicking:
|      Block      | Sneak-right-click |     Right-click     |
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|
| (Soul) Campfire |    Toggle fire    |     Place item      |
|     Crafter     | Toggle triggered  |   Toggle crafting   |
|  Decorated Pot  | Toggle animation  | Place sherd pattern |
| (Sticky) Piston |         -         |   Toggle extended   |
|   Turtle Egg    |  Increase cracks  | Increase egg Count  |

There are many other blocks that can change state by right-clicking.
